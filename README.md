_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Course Description

In this course, Matt Harrison—a Python and data science corporate trainer, author, speaker, consultant, and advisor—focuses on building and deploying value estimation models using Python and machine learning. Learn how to use Linear Regression and XGBoost to predict the value of homes based on their characteristics and location. Explore data exploration, preprocessing, and evaluation techniques. Plus, dive into machine learning by training both simple and advanced models.

## Installation

There are two options for installation:

1. Use Codespaces (the video walks through this):

 - Click on the green "Code" button. Then click on the "Codespaces" tab. Click the "+" button to create a codespace. 
 - Wait a minute or two for the Codespace to provision
 - Open the Jupyter notebook


2. Install with `uv`:

 - Install `uv` as per https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
 - Check out this project:
   
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:LinkedInLearning/applied-machine-learning-value-estimation-3995293.git
   ```

 - Change into the directory of the project:

   ```bash
   cd applied-machine-learning-value-estimation-3995293.git

   ```

 - Run `uv sync` to build the environment.

 - Launch Jupyter with:

  ```bash
  uv run jupyter lab
  ```

 - Open the notebook
